      "summary": "Zelda and David, a recently separated couple, are locked in a bitter custody battle over their daughter, Ava. When they reunite with their new partners under one roof, tensions escalate into a dark, twisted game—each couple secretly plotting to poison the other in a desperate bid for sole custody. \n\nInspired by Impressionism, this film uses light as a metaphor for time to explore the shifting nature of human relationships. As spaces and objects remain unchanged, emotions disintegrate—what once nurtured love now houses its unraveling.\n\nKorean director Won Jang, whose award-winning short film The Stench garnered critical acclaim, is deeply committed to directing this project. As both the writer and the original source of inspiration, he brings a unique personal vision to the story. He believes his intimate connection to the material makes him best suited to authentically convey the characters' emotions in his feature debut.\n\nKey Information\n\nShooting Dates - 5th-15th October 2025\n\nShooting Location - We will be filming in a house near Camelford, Cornwall. You will need to be able to drive to location as public transport doesn’t reach it. Alternatively if you’re London based or in the South of England, we can provide accommodation on set.\n\nRates\n\nThe main characters:  £100 a day \n\nFuel costs will be covered if Cornwall based and the set is catered\n\nHow To Apply\n\nPlease send your headshot and showreel to the following email: assassinationfilm@gmail.com\n\nApplication Deadline: Saturday 13th September\n\nThe Roles\n\nZelda\n\nRequired for the full 10 days\n\nPlaying Age: early 30s to early 40s�\n\nGender: Female�\n\nAccent: Neutral or regional as required\n\nZelda is an emotionally vulnerable yet guarded woman, shaped by the pain of a traumatic miscarriage and the breakdown of her marriage. She presents a sharp wit and a defiant streak, often appearing irritable and defensive. Beneath that, however, is a deep well of longing and emotional complexity. Though she's with a new partner, she remains unsettled—yearning for connection and hoping to find it in the possibility of a new, stable family.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nA background in dance or movement is a plus. Actor must be comfortable portraying psychological nuance, emotional stillness, and layered internal shifts.\n\nThomas\n\nRequired for 6 of the 10 shooting dates (TBD)\n\nPlaying Age: 30's\n\nGender: Male\n\nAccent: Neutral or regional as required\n\nThomas is a shamelessly self-serving man—charming on the surface, but manipulative and cunning underneath. He uses his natural charisma to influence others and mask his true motives, though not as skillfully as he believes. His overconfidence often reveals the cracks in his carefully constructed facade, making his deceit more obvious than he intends.",

Følger man hovedpersonen Dagmar, og hendes venner Anna, Asger og Tobias.\n\nSammen beslutter de 4 venner sig for at tage på en spontan telttur ud på en ø, hvor de laver bål, bader og sætter telte op. Men efterhånden som turen skrider hen, begynder små stykker i Dagmar og Annas venskab at smuldrer, mens Anna lægger alt sin opmærksomhed på Asger. Ser Tobias det som et free pass til Dagmar.

Hun elsker at være i centrum, hun aflæse og manipulere andre. Søger en form for tryghed hos Dagmar, samtidig med at hun bruger hende i hendes spil.

Han er en mand med nag, som føler sig krænket og hævder, at Maren har forbandet ham.

It's a very fun project they will be able to share as a duo, and the director is really great with children. There is a good budget which is tailored to the requirements of French law and practice concerning children and transport, hotel, chaperone and meals will be provided for children who live far from Paris.\n\nIf your child / children are available for shoot on the 13th September and wish to participate, please send in headshot and a short presentation video explaining (in English) why he / she would like to take part in a commercial along with contact details for parents asap and by the latest midnight on Saturday 6th september to the following email :\n\nracheldesmarestcastingbox@gmail.com\n\nPlease indicate \"Paris commercial 13th sep+country of residence of child (UK/FRANCE)\" in the subject of your mail\n\nMany thanks !\n\nIn order to avoid impersonation I always add my posts to my instagram page which is secure and guarantee that the post is genuine : https://instagram.com/racheldesmarest?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA==",

Ich bin auf der Suche nach jemandem, der mich in Sachen Konzept, Script und Regie unterstützen würde.\nVon der Idee soll es um folgendes gehen. \nIch möchte die Geschichte der Titanic aus der Sicht von Thomas Andrews erzählen. Ich beschäftige mich schon länger mit diesem Menschen und finde vieles spannend, wie hat er all das erlebt? Besonders der innere Konflikt, gepaart mit dem Wahnsinn der Zeit und dem schnellen Fortschritt. \n\nAußerdem möchte ich 2-3 Lieder aus dem Titanic Musical ebenfalls verwenden. Unter anderem: In every age, Autum, Andrew's vision. \n\nzu mir: Ich selbst bin ausgebildeter Schauspieler/Sprecher, mit hoher Gesang Affinität, aber keinerlei Musical Erfahrung, deshalb möchte ich es in einem eigenen Projekt gerne mit einbauen. \n\nFür mehr Details uns Anfragen gerne über FB PN, oder direkt eine E-Mail jamesbleyer@mail.de\n\nIch würde mich Kontakte und eine mögliche Zusammenarbeit sehr freuen.",

      "summary": "Es gibt eine Sache, die garantiert das größte Problem der meisten Schauspieler und Darsteller ist. \nJa, eine Sache ist ganz entscheidend. \nWeißt du, was das ist? \n…\nDas eigene Mindset! \nJa, ich weiß, wir hören mittlerweile überall davon. \nAber was ist damit gemeint? \nDu kannst nur vorankommen, wenn du WIRKLICH an dich glaubst. \nDamit meine ich nicht irgendwelche Tschaka-Tschaka-Sprüche. \nAuch nicht vorm Spiegel stehen und sagen “Ich kann das, ich schaffe das, ich bin toll”. \nNein, es ist komplexer. \nDu solltest tiefsitzende Glaubenssätze lösen. \nSo etwas wie Selbstzweifel, weil dir in der dritten Klasse gesagt wurde, dass du nicht gut singst. \nKein Witz!\nWir werden in unserem Leben früh geprägt. \nDa uns kein Lehrer und meist auch nicht unsere Eltern darauf hingewiesen habe, hat all das etwas mit uns gemacht. \nDa können wir noch so “cool” sein. \nAls Kind waren wir das nicht. \nBitte nimm dir die Zeit mal hinzuschauen. \nMachst du das bereits? \n​\n🎉PS: Mindset ist ein wichtiges Thema in unserer Arbeit. Am 05.05. um 14:00 Uhr findet unsere große Abschlussparty statt, in der du noch einmal geballte Ladung Casting-Know-How und viel über das Thema Mindset bekommst.

As he follows the trail of a vague suspect, his investigation descends into a dark odyssey of anxiety and madness. \n\nCasting Roles\nThe Detective – Male Lead, 20s–30s. Tough and gritty exterior, but inwardly sensitive and sorrowful. Brief action violence scene (experience preferred but not required).\nThe Chief – Male Supporting, 40s–60s. Hardened but friendly, a respectable figure.\nIrons – Male Supporting, 20s–40s. A blunt, opinionated officer partnered with the Detective.\nThe Fatale – Female Supporting, 30s. Mature, dignified, but manipulative. Scene requires shuffling cards (experience preferred but not required).\nThe Siren – Female Supporting, 20s. Young companion to the Fatale, charming but irreverent.\n\nTo Submit\nEmail contact@pachecoprojects.com with the subject line: Displaced Audition – [Desired Role]\n\nInclude:\n\nFull Name (as you wish to be credited)\n\nAge\n\nHeight\n\nRelevant Special Skills (see preferences in role breakdowns)\n\nAttach or link:\n\nResume\n\nHeadshot\n\nDramatic Monologue (self-tape, max 60 seconds)\n\nSubmission Deadline: September 13, 2025 (end of day).\nCallbacks with script sides may be requested after that date.\n\nDisplaced is an abstract, black-and-white neo-noir in the tradition of surrealist cinema like David Lynch’s Eraserhead, Orson Welles’ The Trial, or Charlie Kaufman’s I’m Thinking of Ending Things. If those films feel too weird or avant garde, this probably isn’t for you (and that’s okay!). Displaced is written and directed by Raphael Pacheco, a seasoned producer of indie shorts and web series, in his first film since moving to Oklahoma. It will be a minimalistic production, with a small and versatile crew, shooting on a prosumer mirrorless camera, and the cast providing their own outfits (with exceptions for specialty costume/prop pieces required by the script). Expect a tight, intimate set with lots of creative and scrappy problem solving.",

      "summary": "My name is Adelola Mary Haastrup, and I’m a passionate actress currently based in Nigeria. I’m looking to expand my career in the UK and am actively seeking opportunities for visa sponsorship.\n\nI started acting at the age of 7, performing in stage productions. While much of my early work was in gospel theater, I’m not particularly religious, and my focus has always been on the craft of acting. I’m eager to explore a wide range of roles in film, TV, theater, and commercial work, and I’m excited to branch out into new genres and experiences.\n\nIn addition to my acting experience, I studied Music Technology with a major in Stage Performing Arts for 2 years , and I have full documentation of all my final projects from that time. This technical training complements my stage performance and has given me a comprehensive understanding of both the artistic and technical sides of the industry.\n\nI was also part of a gospel drama group form 2011 to 2020 , where I won 4 \"Card Awards,\" including Best Actress  (twice), Best Dressed, and Best Minister. These awards reflect my dedication to the craft, and I’m incredibly proud of them.\n\nI’m looking forward to collaborating on a wide range of acting roles in the UK’s vibrant and inclusive creative industry, and I’m actively seeking potential employers who are willing to support visa sponsorships for skilled performers like me.\n\nIf you have any leads or know of any production companies, agents, or casting opportunities, I would love to hear from you! Please feel free to DM me or comment below.\n\nThank you so much for your time and consideration. I look forward to connecting with you all!",

Producer: Rebecca Sonnenshine (The Boys, Vampire Diaries, Archive 81)\nExec. Producers: Joy Gorman Wettels for Joy Coalition, Trip Friendly for Friendly Family Productions & Dana Fox \nDirector: Sarah Adina Smith\nShooting Location: Winnipeg, Canada\nShoot Dates: Approximately June to October 2025. Candidates must be able to be exclusively available for the entire period.\nSubmission Deadline: April 4th\n\nIntroduction: Based on the iconic book series written by Laura Ingalls Wilder, Netflix’s Little House on the Prairie is an epic and thrilling family adventure of the mythic American West. Since its original publication in the 1930s, the LITTLE HOUSE book series and brand has remained a constant in the global zeitgeist. The classic novels have sold over 73 million copies in more than 100 countries, translated into at least 27 languages.\n\nProject Synopsis: Part hopeful family drama, part epic survival tale, and part origin story of the American West, this fresh adaptation of Laura Ingalls Wilder’s iconic semi-autobiographical Little House books offers a kaleidoscopic view of the struggles and triumphs of those who shaped the frontier.\n\nSubmission Instructions: \n1. Intro - Say your Name, Age, Height & Location (where you live) to the camera. Then zoom out to a full body shot. PLEASE put the intro in its own file. We do NOT want the intro on the same file as the scenes. Please label each audition file by Scene Number (S1, S2). Please submit only one take of each scene. \n\n2. Lighting & Sound - Please ensure that your face is well lit and that the external microphone is close enough to clearly understand what you are saying in the audition.\n\n3. Framing & Taping - Please frame the shot from the top of head to mid chest. Please place the camera/phone somewhere stable like a tripod or a flat surface. If you are taping with a smart phone, please turn it horizontally. Do not do the scene directly to camera, but rather focus on the person reading the scene with you.  That reader should stand next to the camera.\n\n4. Takes & Scenes - Please have another person read the other characters lines off-screen and stand next to the camera.  (please do not read the stage directions).\n\nWe are committed to providing equal employment opportunity. For every role, please submit qualified performers, without regard to disability, race, age, color, national origin, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other basis prohibited by law. The persons and events depicted in this casting breakdown are fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons or events is unintentional.\nRole(s): Download Sides: \n\nLAURA INGALLS\nCharacter is a white Female, 9-11 years old. Laura is a disruptor. Honest to a fault. Questions authority. She is observant, tender more... strong-willed, hot-tempered. She resists the bounds of 19th-century ladylike behavior — she likes to hunt and run barefoot and feel the sun on her face. She is curious and optimistic and fearless and is quick to confront anyone who is cruel or unjust. She loves fiercely and unapologetically and is utterly devoted to her dog, Jack. She absorbs every detail she sees around her, collecting them for stories she will someday share with the world. SERIES REGULAR less...",

Could be mysterious, slightly bizarre, serene, intense, or all of the above.\n\nHeight over 190cm is a bonus, but not a must.\n\nWe will consider every application.

Han lever fuldt ud i sin idé om at være kunstnerisk, men må se sig tilfreds med freelancing jobs. Stålfast i sine principper om, at film er kunst og ikke til for, at studio executives kan købe nye både og biler.\n* **Miranda: **Har hyret instruktøren til at filme for sin OnlyFans. Ønsker at lave små forhistorier til sine videoer, men synes instruktørens historie er for karikeret. Da instruktøren forlanger at se kærlighed mellem spillerne, foreslår hun at han laver Titanic 2.\n* **Valentin:** Primært vulgær og primitiv. Han tænker kun på sex og er ligeglad med instruktørens kunstneriske ambitioner.\n* **Produceren:** Rationel og fornuftig. Bekendt af instruktøren gennem Den Danske Filmskole. Holder benene på jorden og prøver at styre forventningerne.\n* **CFO’en: **CEO’ens talerør, gør alt i den rette ånd for selskabet og for at maksimere profit.\n* **CEO’en:** Har magten over filmselskabet. Siger ingenting, lader sin CFO tale, medmindre den endelige beslutning skal tages.\n\n**Dynamik:**\nEn selvhøjtidelig instruktør insisterer på at være en stor kunstner – selv midt i et amatør-porno-setup. Samtidig møder han en kynisk filmbranche, der kun tænker på superhelte og at sælge biografbilletter. Midt i al galskaben bliver en tilfældig joke fra pornoskuespillerinden om *Titanic 2* pludselig instruktørens uventede vej til succes.\n\n**Optagelserne finder sted 9, 10 og 11 september i Århus. **\n\n**Rollerne er ulønnet. **Men der vil være forplejninger, og rig mulighed for at styrke sin showreel.\n\n**Casting** afholdes i Århus C **tirsdag d. 2. sep fra 9-15. **\n\nHvis det lyder som noget for dig, så send evt en introduktionsvideo og showreel (hvis du har) til sara774g@gmail.com - og gerne hvilken rolle du tænker, passer bedst til dig. Så sender vi manus.\n\nVi glæder os til at høre fra dig!\n\nDe bedste hilsner, Simon, Sara, Frida og Melanie",

Therapist, Buddhist, loves hiking, gives people the benefit of the doubt. But this situation is just a little too doubtful. \n\n**Film date**: Unknown, but most likely a weekend in October. One day\n\n**Location:** Unknown, but most likely in Aurora CO.\n\n**Compensation:** None but free lunch & gas\n\n***SECOND:***\n\n**Title:** The Baseball Bat\n\n**Genre: **Comedic Thriller\n\n**Logline**: Jake has tools to manage his anxiety now. But he comes across his biggest hurdle yet: chaperoning a group of detention students who learn that faking a concussion can get them out of class early. Will this prove to be too much for him or will he finally resolve a worry on his own? \n\n**Roles:** Students, ages 7-14. All genders and ethnicities. You'll be extras but you'll be able to improvise your own lines!\n\n**Shooting date**: Unknown, because we still have to find a school that'd be willing to let me film there, but hopefully some time in October or November, most likely soon after school gets let out on a weekday. Only one day. \n\n**Shooting location**: Also unknown, but definitely a school of some sort either in the Denver or Aurora area. \n\nKindly email me at jakewunger@gmail.com or text at 571.276.4722 if interested! All extras welcome (no auditions necessary) and Jeremy applicants should get an email with a prompt for remote auditions within the next two weeks. Thanks!",

Vi er et ambitiøst hold unge filmskabere fra Potemkin - Den Jyske Filmskoles Masterclass, der søger skuespillere til vores første projekt dette semester.\n\n \n\n**RESUME**: En velklædt bankmand hjælper en blind mand over en bro, men bliver bestjålet i processen. Da han opsøger ham for at få sine ting tilbage, opdager han, at “den blinde” forsørger en fattig familie gennem småbedrag. Konfrontationen blotlægger kontrasten mellem de små forbrydelser, der holder en familie i live, og de store privilegier, som bankmanden selv dagligt opretholder – og tvinger ham til at overveje, hvem der i virkeligheden er blind.\n\nHovedrollen er fundet og vi søger nu disse roller\n\n**“BLIND MAND”:**\n\nEn mand på omkring 35 år, fattig og arbejdsløs, kæmper for at forsørge sin kone og deres fire børn. I sin desperation ser han ingen anden udvej end at snyde folk for at skaffe mad på bordet. Han udgiver sig for at være blind – en løgn, der tærer på hans samvittighed. Inderst inde skammer han sig over bedraget, men af ren nød og afmagt føler han sig tvunget til at fortsætte, fordi han vil gøre alt for sin familie.\n\n**ASSISTENT:**\n\nEn kvinde på omkring 25 år, der uden tøven gør, hvad der bliver sagt. Hun elsker både sit arbejde og følelsen af magt, og hendes trivsel afhænger af, at hendes chef er tilfreds. En glad chef giver hende ikke bare glæde, men også mulige bonusser og fordele.\n\n**ET PAR (MAND & DAME):**\n\nUngt ægtepar, der bliver afvist et lån i Banken.\n\nMand - 25-40\n\nKvinde - 25-40\n\n**BARISTA: **\n\n18-25, køn underordnet - ung energisk barista\n\n**GADETIGGER:**\n\nStereotypisk gadetigger udseende og adfærd søges til denne rolle.\n\n**Praktisk**: \n\nOptagelserne foregår i og omkring Aarhus C. mellem den 8.-10. september. \n\nCasting kommer til at foregå mandag/tirsdag 1./2. september. på Potemkin - Den Jyske Filmskole, Fredens Torv 3A, Aarhus C - Respektive specifikke tidspunkter aftales over mail.\n\nEr du interresseret i en af rollerne, kan du tage fat i mig på Mail.

      "summary": "CASTING CALL\n\nSITE SPECIFIC THEATRE \n\nExperienced and serious actor with strong focus, intuition and comic timing needed for a single person site specific English language play, that takes place in a car with only four audience members (who are also in the car). Age and gender is not specified. Must be available for performances in late-May or April with a month of rehearsal before. Pay is from ticket sales profit share, with majority to the performer. Performance will be presented under the umbrella of a Berlin performance venue.\n\nShort pitch: Four people are invited to view a car for sale, what unfolds is a touching and strange monologue from the seller about modern alienation, the death of ennui and the managed decline of our futures. With their headspace stuck somewhere between an endlessly distracted doom scroll and a deep and meaningful, the seller tries to attempt to truly connect with the possible buyers. All whilst being unsure if they can actually let go of the sacred decaying automobile.\n\nFor archive and promotion much of the dress rehearsal will be filmed with cinema cameras and produced to a high standard not normally available to underground theatre. Whilst the number of audience members will be very limited this video and promotional material will be of a very high standard. \n\nAbout me: I'm a Melbourne born, Berlin/London based film director diving back into theatre after a long hiatus. A creative space I'm looking forward to diving into in site specific experimental pieces over the coming year. I’m on the hunt for performers in Berlin hungry to do thought provoking, fresh and intense work. The world is on fire. Let’s make things that we can be proud of, before we’re all burnt. You can see a large portfolio of my film work here: [**https://vimeo.com/timkelly**]\n\nBefore April 10, please email relevant portfolio materials to: [timothygeorgekelly@gmail.com] with subject: “Carpark Casting”",

      "title": "# CASTING CALL: JOIN OUR ACTING PODCAST\n\nWhen a group of actors sit around a tab…",
      "summary": "# CASTING CALL: JOIN OUR ACTING PODCAST\n\nWhen a group of actors sit around a table and use their spoken words to portray characters all going on an adventure together, that's called a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG). Our gaming group plays a variety of tabletop roleplaying games and publishes the audio as a podcast. Example famous ttrpg podcasts: Critical Role, The Adventure Zone, etc. We react as our character to the scenario presented by the game master. We respond to challenges, overcome obstacles, make jokes and laugh with our fellow acting friends. Would you enjoy acting in-character for a podcast audience? Join us.\n\n# When we play:\n\nWeekends. Both European and American time zones. Joining us doesn't commit you to every weekend. Instead, we pick games we want to try and sign up for those calendar spots.\n\n# How long we play / what it’s like:\n\nOur members sit at their microphones for four hours talking their way through an adventure using their words and laughter to entertain each other. We use theater of the mind, saying out loud how far away targets are instead of looking at combat maps on a screen. The recordings are high quality, and we air the audio as a podcast. Don’t worry, we don’t publish our names or faces.\n\n# System played:\n\nWe get to learn and play a different tabletop roleplaying game (ttrpg) system each session. There’s no financial burden to you. The systems are either free to everyone or we were sent a free promotional copy from its creator.\n\n# Oneshot or campaign:\n\nBoth. Like a traditional campaign, we repeatedly meet familiar non player characters (NPCs), facing challenges and experiencing long term character growth. We play our same character for a year. Our characters start at low power in January, grow to epic max fighting strength by December, then retire. Like a oneshot, each individual episode opens with a beginning to its plot, and the exploration of its story ends after four hours.\n\n# Game Mastering (GMing):\n\nWe rotate so that everyone is invited to be a player and a game master if they want. The GM gets to pick which ttrpg we play that weekend. If you find a fun ttrpg you want to try, you can sign up as the GM and be confident that there will be players excited to play with you. If you prefer to be a player every time that’s cool, too. Our members don't have to GM ever if they want a break from it. Getting to pick how often you GM really helps relieve burnout. GM as often as makes you happy.\n\n# You can vibe check past games:\n\nWe're on itunes, spotify, youtube, and all the podcast apps. Our cast rotates. Skip around and listen to snippets from a few episodes to see which of our members you want to play with first. The episodes aren't all great, but we have fun together. This isn't a job. It's a hobby, a way to relax and laugh meeting new people who slowly over time become lifelong friends. It's okay to miss games; you aren’t expected to be present for every session. The opt-in format naturally minimizes table trouble because you can see who’s signed up to GM and play in a game before you join it, and can pick dates that have people you’re looking forward to playing with.\n\n# Joining:\n\nTo join, email us at FirebreathingKittensPodcast at gmail dot com and tell us about your equipment. Our minimum requirement is 24 bit audio (not 16 bit). If you don’t know what 24 bit audio means that’s not a problem, the new members tab of FirebreathingKittensPodcast dot com has an equipment section that explains what all the microphone words mean with pictures and videos. We welcome members of all experience levels and will train you. The new members tab also has info about our format and answers to frequently asked questions. Minimum age 21 years old. We reply to all emails from people who have 24 bit audio within three days with a support agreement for you to sign, and then will guide you through character creation and train you how to record great audio.",

      "summary": "Hey peeps in Kansas or peeps who know peeps in Kansas!!\nI'm doing a casting that is specificaly looking for real Kansans. Is that how you say it? I should know, I married a green eye'd Kansas boy... but anyway, back to the point. I'm looking for a bunch of people and they can be from anywhere in the state. The filming team will come to you or at least pretty darn close to you.\nThe pay is $500 per person - even if your whole family books it\nUsage: OOH, CTV, Social, Web, Print, Banners, Industrial, in perpetuity\nIt'd be awesome if you were actual BCBS customers, but you don't have to be! And you don't need to have any on camera experience.\nIf you fit the bill, please send an email with a photo of you and a little blurb about you and why you fit the project. Send it to shauna@sebcasting.com by end of day Friday Aug 29th.\nHere are some specific people we're looking for, but we are also loking for just your regular Kansas folks too.\n1) Farmer - We’re looking for a real farmer, any age, who works the land while managing a visible health challenge. This could be a prosthetic arm, an insulin pump, a hearing aid, or anything that shows their body has been through something and they are still out there doing the work and living their life.\nThis is not about overcoming a set-back in a glossy, commercial way. It is about the everyday toughness of someone who gets up before sunrise, feeds the animals, fixes the tractor, and keeps going. Dirt under the nails, sun on the face, humor in the voice. Someone who looks like they actually know what calluses feel like.\nAll races and genders are welcome. We want authenticity over polish. People not pretending to be farmers but real ones.\n2) A student athlete - A real-deal young athlete, age 15–20, who’s currently in the thick of rehabbing a noticeable injury. This could be an ACL, ankle, shoulder. Something that leaves a brace, crutches, or scar, something that we as the viewer can see and feel in a split second.\nWe’re not shooting for shiny highlight reels or staged comebacks. We want the raw in-between. A kid still rocking the team hoodie at physical therapy. The one who hears the squeak of the gym floor but has to watch from the sideline. Someone with grit, humor, and honesty in how they carry themselves.\nAll races and backgrounds are welcome. We’re especially interested in faces and stories that look like real life, not polished models, or someone who is playing a role, but the real people. They should have a look of determination on their face. This isn’t a set-back but a stage for what comes next.\n3) A graveyard shift worker - This isn’t about polished smiles or hero shots. It’s the tired eyes at 3 a.m., the coﬀee that barely keeps you upright, the quiet moments in fluorescent light when the world feels stuck in pause. Someone who looks like they know what it feels like to walk out of work and see the sun rise before they’ve even gone to bed.\nAll races, genders, and ages are welcome. We want someone real, not staged. A person who carries the weight of the night shift in the way they stand, move, and speak.\nPrefer BCBS members\n4) A 4H kid - We’re not after a glossy champion. We want the kid who smells like hay by noon, whose boots are dusty, and whose face says they’ve been up since sunrise. Someone who knows long rides in a pickup, the heat that sticks to your skin, and the noise of the barns drowning out the noise of the competition.\nAll races and backgrounds welcome. We want real Kansas kids who treat the fairgrounds like a second home, kids who know the dust, the heat, and the rhythm of competition better than the tourists ever will.\n5) Hunters & Fishers - We are looking for real Kansans. Not models, not overly polished actors, but people who tell the true story of this state. People who represent Kansas in the way they stand, the way they work, the way they are. Our audience should be able to look at them and\nthink: that could be me, that could be my neighbor, that could be my family.\nWe are not looking for perfection. We are looking for authenticity. Lives that have been well-lived. Hands that show they have worked. Eyes that carry both resilience and pride.\nPeople that without a single word,but a single look, can tell you where they are from and what they stand for, in an instant.\nThis cast should feel like Kansas itself, wide, varied, and diverse. From big cities, small towns, and open plains. Every age, every background, and every walk of life. People whose presence says something true before they even have to talk.\n6) Fossil diggers/Rock hounds - We are not looking for perfection. We are looking for authenticity. Lives that have been well-lived. Hands that show they have worked. Eyes that carry both resilience and pride.\nPeople that without a single word,but a single look, can tell you where they are from and what they stand for, in an instant.\nThis cast should feel like Kansas itself, wide, varied, and diverse. From big cities, small towns, and open plains. Every age, every background, and every walk of life. People whose presence says something true before they even have to talk.\n7) College students - Young people who tell the story of campus life in Kansas. We are looking for real Kansans. Not models, not overly polished actors, but people who\ntell the true story of this state. People who represent Kansas in the way they stand, the\nway they work, the way they are. Our audience should be able to look at them and think: that could be me, that could be my neighbor, that could be my family. We are not looking for perfection. We are looking for authenticity. This cast should feel like Kansas itself, wide, varied, and diverse. From big cities, small\ntowns, and open plains. Every age, every background, and every walk of life. People whose presence says something true before they even have to talk.",

We're casting for ***\"And Then Jeff Killed Everyone,\"*** a dark comedy horror pilot that playfully twists the paranormal investigation genre.\n\nThis is an unpaid student film, but it's a chance to work on a distinctive script, get high-quality footage for your reel, and connect with a passionate local film crew. We're looking for dedicated actors to fill these roles:\n\n**Available Roles:**\n* **Don Logins: **(Male, 20s-30s) Think Zak Bagans and Ed Hardy t-shirts. He's intense, self-indulgent, with gelled hair and an over-the-top style. Don is convinced of his own coolness and obsessed with proving ghosts are real, mostly for the fame. A fantastic opportunity for an actor who can lean into an exaggerated, yet committed, performance.\n* **Nicole:** (Female, 20s-30s) Our kind, soft-spoken, and friendly Team Case Researcher. She's genuinely passionate about finding evidence of life after death and grounds the team with her sincerity. This role needs an actor who can convey warmth and a quiet determination.\n* **Casey:** (Male, 20s-30s) Very intelligent and level-headed, with a dry wit. He approaches the paranormal with a healthy dose of skepticism but genuinely wants to see a ghost. We're looking for an actor who can deliver intelligent humor and a grounded presence.\n* **Frankie:** (Male, 20s-30s) From Boston with a heavy accent, Frankie's a bit squirrelly and prone to screwing up. He's more of a film student than a paranormal investigator, initially a skeptic, and often finds himself in over his head. Great for an actor who excels at physical comedy and portrays nervous energy.\n* **Stefania:** (Female, 20s-40s) A very no-nonsense medium with a Natasha Lyonne-type vibe. She's mostly nice to others but can be blunt. She claims to be a medium but is well aware that many think it's BS (and thinks those people can screw themselves). This role is perfect for an actor who can balance a strong, confident personality with comedic timing and a subtle layer of deception.\n\n**If you're ready to dive into a fun and memorable project, please submit your headshot and resume to Chrismusick23@gmail.com. We can't wait to see your auditions!**",

      "summary": "This is me (and Zoe), ten years into a journey that almost never started.\n\nAt 47, after a 16-year break, I tried to relaunch my acting career in Germany with no reel, no contacts, and very rusty skills. I had no idea how to explain the gap on my resume, and the thought of walking into a casting room again terrified me.\n\nBut giving up was not an option.\n\nThe solution hit me when I realized the problem itself was pointing the way forward. I needed training in English at a high level, and it did not exist in Munich. Flying to London, LA, or New York was unrealistic.\n\nSo I organized the workshops myself.\n\nWhat happened next changed everything.\n\nInstead of stumbling around in the dark trying to figure it out again, I could hit the ground running. Whenever I needed something like showreel material, headshots, the right kind of training, I organized it and got what I needed. If I had tried to piece it all together on my own, it would have taken ten times as long, and I did not have that kind of time.\n\nThat approach became my foundation. It is what eventually opened doors to work with studios like A24, Netflix, and Hallmark.\n\nAlong the way, I got world-class training for free as the organizer. A community of actors formed around those workshops. And unexpectedly, it also turned into steady income.\n\nHere is the breakthrough: I always believed you had to \"make it\" before you could make money as a creative. What I discovered is that the journey itself can pay for itself.\n\nUse what you need, whether that is training, practice, connections, or visibility, and shape it into something that lets other people get what they need too. That way you move your craft forward, build real relationships, get seen, and the process funds itself.\n\nAt first, I thought this only worked for actors because that is where I started. But the more I shared my story, the more I heard the same frustrations from other creatives: photographers, writers, artisans, even people into things like fermentation or traditional crafts. That's when it clicked. This approach is not just about acting. It can work anywhere someone is willing to use what they need to build what they want.\n\nTen years later, I am still living this way. I am constantly building skills, deepening connections, getting more visible in my craft, and funding it all as I go.\n\nI am sharing this because I know too many people who keep their passions in the \"someday\" box. They wait until they feel \"ready\" or \"expert enough\" before letting themselves imagine it could actually support them.\n\nBut what if the very thing you think is holding you back is actually your starting point to a creative life that fits?\n\n👉 For me, it was not having reel material or training. What’s been that thing for you?",

      "summary": "# CASTING CALL: JOIN OUR ACTING PODCAST\n\nWhen a group of actors sit around a table and use their spoken words to portray characters all going on an adventure together, that's called a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG). Our gaming group plays a variety of tabletop roleplaying games and publishes the audio as a podcast. Example famous ttrpg podcasts: Critical Role, The Adventure Zone, etc. We react as our character to the scenario presented by the game master. We respond to challenges, overcome obstacles, make jokes and laugh with our fellow acting friends. Would you enjoy acting in-character for a podcast audience? Join us.\n\n# When we play:\n\nWeekends. Both European and American time zones. Joining us doesn't commit you to every weekend. Instead, we pick games we want to try and sign up for those calendar spots.\n\n# How long we play / what it’s like:\n\nOur members sit at their microphones for four hours talking their way through an adventure using their words and laughter to entertain each other. We use theater of the mind, saying out loud how far away targets are instead of looking at combat maps on a screen. The recordings are high quality, and we air the audio as a podcast. Don’t worry, we don’t publish our names or faces.\n\n# System played:\n\nWe get to learn and play a different tabletop roleplaying game (ttrpg) system each session. There’s no financial burden to you. The systems are either free to everyone or we were sent a free promotional copy from its creator.\n\n# Oneshot or campaign:\n\nBoth. Like a traditional campaign, we repeatedly meet familiar non player characters (NPCs), facing challenges and experiencing long term character growth. We play our same character for a year. Our characters start at low power in January, grow to epic max fighting strength by December, then retire. Like a oneshot, each individual episode opens with a beginning to its plot, and the exploration of its story ends after four hours.\n\n# Game Mastering (GMing):\n\nWe rotate so that everyone is invited to be a player and a game master if they want. The GM gets to pick which ttrpg we play that weekend. If you find a fun ttrpg you want to try, you can sign up as the GM and be confident that there will be players excited to play with you. If you prefer to be a player every time that’s cool, too. Our members don't have to GM ever if they want a break from it. Getting to pick how often you GM really helps relieve burnout. GM as often as makes you happy.\n\n# You can vibe check past games:\n\nWe're on itunes, spotify, youtube, and all the podcast apps. Our cast rotates. Skip around and listen to snippets from a few episodes to see which of our members you want to play with first. The episodes aren't all great, but we have fun together. This isn't a job. It's a hobby, a way to relax and laugh meeting new people who slowly over time become lifelong friends. It's okay to miss games; you aren’t expected to be present for every session. The opt-in format naturally minimizes table trouble because you can see who’s signed up to GM and play in a game before you join it, and can pick dates that have people you’re looking forward to playing with.\n\n# Joining:\n\nTo join, email us at FirebreathingKittensPodcast at gmail dot com and tell us about your equipment. Our minimum requirement is 24 bit audio (not 16 bit). If you don’t know what 24 bit audio means that’s not a problem, the new members tab of FirebreathingKittensPodcast dot com has an equipment section that explains what all the microphone words mean with pictures and videos. We welcome members of all experience levels and will train you. The new members tab also has info about our format and answers to frequently asked questions. Minimum age 21 years old. We reply to all emails from people who have 24 bit audio within three days with a support agreement for you to sign, and then will guide you through character creation and train you how to record great audio.",

      "summary": "🎬 Casting Call – Kort drama-dokumentar om Maren Spliids 🎬\n\nVi er en gruppe filmstuderende, der arbejder på en drama-dokumentar om hekseprocessen mod Maren Spliids i 1641 – en af de mest kendte hekseafbrændinger i Danmark.\n\nVi søger nu skuespillere til følgende roller:\n\n⸻\n\n• Maren Spliids (hovedrolle, kvinde, ca. 30–45 år)\n\nEn stærk, selvstændig kvinde, der sammen med sin mand (Lauritz) driver værtshus i Ribe. Hun er kendt for sit temperament, sin stolthed og sit mod til at sige tingene, som de er – træk, der også gør hende sårbar i en tid, hvor kvinder helst skulle tie stille. Hun nægter at bekende sig skyldig, og agter at kæmpe for sin frihed\n\n• Lauritz Spliids (birolle, mand, ca. 30–50 år)\n\nMaren Spliids mand og medejer af byens værtshus. Han er en vellidt og anerkendt borger, men presses hårdt under hekseanklagerne mod hans hustru. Lauritz er splittet mellem kærligheden til Maren og frygten for at miste både hende og familiens anseelse.\n\n• Didrik Skrædder (birolle, mand, ca. 30–45 år)\n\nEn skrædder fra Flensborg og Marens hovedanklager. Han er en mand med nag, som føler sig krænket og hævder, at Maren har forbandet ham. Hans vrede og stædighed driver sagen fremad – en karakter, der balancerer mellem at virke tragisk og skræmmende.\n\n• Christian IV (birolle, mand, ca. 50–60 år)\n\nDanmarks konge. En magtfuld, karismatisk og egenrådig hersker. Han repræsenterer autoriteten og den uindskrænkede magt, hvor ét eneste ord kan afgøre et menneskes skæbne. En rolle med stor pondus og historisk tyngde.\n\n✨ **Vi søger også statister**\n\nHar du lyst til at være en del af optagelserne, men uden at spille en større rolle? Vi mangler statister til at skabe liv og stemning i filmen – fx som borgere, til retsoptrin eller til scener med folkemængder. Ingen erfaring er nødvendig, bare lysten til at være med og bidrage til den historiske atmosfære.\n\n⸻\n\n📍 Optagelser: Finder sted fra 1-12 september i Storkøbenhavn/Nordsjælland (nærmere info følger).\n\n🎥 Format: 15 minutters drama-dokumentar (uddannelsesprojekt).\n\n🤝 Det er et studenterprojekt, så vi kan desværre ikke tilbyde løn, men vi sørger for forplejning på set.\n\nFor interesse, kontakt instruktør Nikolaj Willerslev Rosenmejer på tlf 22823282 eller på mail: nikolaj1099@gmail.com",

Sometimes I find him saying things that I mentally live by and its so refreshing to constantly hear them being affirmed. Thank you so much for every week re-instilling that positivity and creativity and openness within. You allow me as an actor to forget about the character and remember about Shailene, which makes every movement, moment and word so authentic and true. I’m so grateful to have you as a mentor.”",

Set aboard a transatlantic ocean liner, the musical follows an unpredictable voyage of love triangles and mistaken identities. With timeless standards like “You’re the Top,” “I Get a Kick Out of You,” and the title song, *Anything Goes* blends romance, comedy, and show-stopping dance.\n\n \n\nAuditions (by appointment):\n\nSunday, November 2, 6-9pm\n\nMonday, November 3, 7-10pm\n\n \n\nCallbacks (by invitation only):\n\nSaturday, November 8, 10am-3pm.

Bring sheet music in the correct key; accompanist will be provided. Please bring a headshot, résumé, and audition form provided on the SignUp.\n\n \n\nThere will be a mandatory tap call at auditions for anyone auditioning for Reno or the Angels.  However, tap skills will be a plus for anyone auditioning, so if you have tap experience or even think you can fake it in jazz shoes, we’d love to see you at the tap call as well.  There will be at least two of the tap calls each audition night, so you should attend the one closest to your audition time.  There will be a separate movement call at callbacks for the non-tappers.    \n\n \n\nPlease contact Katina at artisticdirector@altarena.org should you have any questions.\n\n \n\nPerformers of all races, ethnicities, and genders are encouraged to audition. Non-AEA only.

      "summary": "English and German in-person acting courses in Berlin and online globally with Isabelle Mann.\n\nIsabelle is a degree holding international working actress, acting coach, and screenwriter.\n\nHer work is influenced by a long-time collaboration with Robert Castle, a unique director renowned for the evolution of ‘Method acting’ and the founder of International Theatre New York, and Susan Batson, one of the most significant Hollywood acting coaches in the world.\n\nHer method is based on ‘Method acting’, a technique originally created by Stanislavsky and further developed by Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, and Sanford Meisner. The actor is trained to create the character’s life using the senses, in order to produce a reality. The actor discovers a physical and emotional availability that leads to working moment-to-moment, based on spontaneous organic impulses and their free expression through the character. The technique offers actors the freedom to be emotionally available, and artistically creative in both theatre and film.\n\nIsabelle works with scenes and monologues from well-known playwrights such as Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, William Shakespeare, Harold Pinter, Caryl Churchill, Alan Ayckbourn, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Sibylle Berg, Ingmar Bergman, Jean-Paul Sartre, Dario Fo & Franca Rame et al., film scripts or scenes of your choice.\n\nStudents she prepared for auditions at drama schools succeeded in gaining admission to institutions such as the renowned Ernst Busch Academy of Dramatic Arts in Berlin, or completed an acting degree at the Bern University of the Arts, performing the monologues they rehearsed with her. Actors she prepared for film and series roles were subsequently booked for their respective projects.\n\nIn addition to her acting career, she is also a certified life coach.\n\nACTING CLASSES FOR ALL LEVELS\n\nFrom beginner to highly experienced film and stage actors.\n\n•Intensive individual preparation for auditions at theatres, drama schools or films.\n\n•Intensive individual preparation for film or stage roles.\n\n•Working on monologues and scenes.\n\n•Self-tape training and filming.\n\n•Speech and voice training.\n\n•Individual coaching to support your growth as an artist.\n\n•Insider tips, helping to find the right talent agent, networking tips, etc.\n\nContact: coaching@isabelle-mann.com\n\nhttps://www.isabelle-mann.com/en/acting_coach.htm\n\n#isabellemann #actor #actingcoach",

But as the hours pass, she must face her fear of intimacy and decide whether she’s brave enough to let herself be seen, or whether she’ll retreat into the familiar pain she knows best.\n\n**Roles:**\n\n**SOFIA (Female, 20s)**\n\nEnergetic, provocative, emotionally layered. Sofia hides vulnerability behind bravado and chaos. A complex and contradictory presence: fierce on the outside, fragile underneath.\n\n \n\n**THEO (Male, 20s)**\n\nCharming, stylish, emotionally elusive. A golden boy with a hollow centre. Looks like he has it all but fears deep connection.\n\n \n\n**ALICE (Female, 20s)**\n\nComposed and elegant, the group's steadying force. She hides her dependence behind polished control, terrified of losing grip on who she thinks she is.\n\n \n\n**MATILDE (Female, 20s)**\n\nSharp, rebellious, impulsive. The wildcard. She rejects love out loud but secretly longs for it – and for Quillan.\n\n \n\n**QUILLAN (Male, 20s)**\n\nGentle, romantic, emotionally present. The quiet heart of the group. Steady and sincere in a world of irony and games.\n\n**Interested in auditioning?**\nPlease send your **CV**, **headshot**, **showreel (if available)** and a few lines about yourself to:\n[00457876@metfilmstudents.de](mailto:00457876@metfilmstudents.de)\n\n \n\nApplications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.
